This talk explores the benefits and challenges of this approach, including strategies for maintaining code quality and consistency across projects. We'll discuss how to leverage the strengths of multiple frameworks to create innovative solutions and the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                     | Action                                           |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`               | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`               | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`             | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`           | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`         | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
